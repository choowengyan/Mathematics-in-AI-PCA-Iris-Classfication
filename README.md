Juypter Notebook file is named as "MAI CA1 Question 1" 

### Fisher’s Iris data set
Fisher's Iris Dataset is named after British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher, is one of the most commonly used in machine learning. 
Refer to the data file iris.csv, the data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species or ‘class’ of Iris – Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. 

Four variables were measured from each sample – the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. The aim is to use data to distinguish the species from each other (i.e. classification)

The notebook file for this is named as "MAI CA1 Question 2"
