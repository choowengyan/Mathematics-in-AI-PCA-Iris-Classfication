Fisher's Iris Dataset is named after British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher, is one of the most commonly used in machine learning. 
Refer to the data file iris.csv, the data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species or ‘class’ of Iris – Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor.
